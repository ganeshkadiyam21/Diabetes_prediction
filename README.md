# Diabetes_prediction
Millions of individuals worldwide are afflicted with diabetes, which is an increasing public health 
concern. Diabetes must be identified and treated early in order to lower the risk of significant 
complications such heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. Machine learning algorithms have been 
employed more frequently in recent years to create predictive models for identifying people who are at 
a high risk of getting diabetes. 
Using four well-known machine learning algorithms—Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Support Vector 
Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and Decision Tree (DT)—the goal of this study 
is to create a diabetes prediction model. Based on a number of variables, including age, BMI, blood 
pressure, and glucose levels, the model attempts to predict the likelihood of getting diabetes. 
To train and evaluate the model, we'll use a publicly accessible dataset of 768 patients. To increase the 
model's accuracy and decrease overfitting, we will also apply a variety of data preprocessing techniques 
like normalisation, feature scaling, and feature selection. Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and 
ROC-AUC are just a few of the metrics that will be used to assess the model's performance. 
With the help of this study, we seek to establish the best algorithm for predicting diabetes as well as the 
most significant risk variables. For those who are at a high risk of developing diabetes, this information 
can be utilised to create screening programmes and therapies that are more focused and effective. 
Overall, this research has the potential to greatly enhance diabetes care and prevention, thereby lowering 
the burden of this chronic condition on individuals and society
